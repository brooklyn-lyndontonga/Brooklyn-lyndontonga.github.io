       Here are some of my notes on what Classes & IDs are:
    </h2>
    
    <h2>
      Classes:
    </h2>
    <p>
      Used for groups of elements:
      When you want to add the same style or property to multiple elements.

      Multiple classes can be used:
      An element can have more than one class, so you can change more than one thing at a time.
      
      Reusable: 
      You can use the same class on many elements, so it can be used in different parts of your page.
    </p>
    
    <h2>
      IDs:
    </h2>
    <p>
      Use for unique elements: 
      When you want to add a specific thing to a page, example: font thats different to the rest of the page.

      One ID per page: 
      The ID will only affect the page that its on.

      Single use: 
      Only one element can have a particular ID.
    </p>

    <h2>
      These are my notes on what best practice looks like:
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Use classes for styling and grouping: 
      Apply styles or behaviors to groups of elements that share something in common, like h1, h2, h3, p, border, padding, etc.

      2. Use IDs for unique elements: 
      Identify and apply styles or behaviors to a single, specific element, like titles and headings.

      3. Keep IDs unique: 
      Only use an ID once on a page.

      4. Combine classes when needed:
      An element can have multiple classes if it fits into multiple groups.
    </p>

    <h2>
      To summarise my learnings:
    </h2>
    <p>
    Classes: Group elements together.
    IDs: Identify single, unique elements.
    Use classes for multiple elements.
    Use IDs for individual elements.
    Ensure each ID is unique on a page.
    </p>
